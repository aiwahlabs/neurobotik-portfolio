## What Does Neurobotik Do?

Neurobotik designs and manages AI assistants that handle repetitive customer questions inside your existing tools, so your team can focus on high-value work – not copy-pasting the same replies.

**We are NOT a new Helpdesk tool** – we're your AI support operations partner, running on top of tools you already use.

We combine proven AI tools, human oversight, and clear reporting so every response is on-brand and compliant.

**Key Benefits:**
- Cut response times by 25–40%
- Works with tools like Zendesk, Intercom, HubSpot & shared inboxes
- No in-house AI team needed
- AI assistant works 24/7, never takes time off, and keeps improving

---

## The Problem We Solve

Your support team spends hours every week answering the same questions:
- "Where is my order?"
- "How do I log in?"
- "Can I change my booking?"

**The result:**
- Customers wait longer than they should
- Staff get burnt out
- Costs keep creeping up
- Generic chatbots don't help – they're off-brand, hard to maintain, and often say the wrong thing

**What you need:** Something that plugs into your existing tools, uses your tone and policies, and quietly takes the repetitive load away.

---

## Who Is Neurobotik For?

We primarily work with **US, Canada, and Australia-based B2B companies** in tech, service, and e-commerce sectors. However, any business that handles high customer support volumes can benefit.

### Is Neurobotik a Good Fit?

| Fit | Criteria |
|-----|----------|
| **NOT a good fit** | You're only getting a handful of enquiries per month – this probably isn't for you, and we're happy to say that. |
| **Good fit** | You're handling **50+ support enquiries per month**, your team is stuck answering the same questions, and you want to reduce repetitive workload. |

**Not sure?** Book a free discovery call and we'll tell you if your current support volume is too low for this to make sense right now.

## How It Works: Connect → Train → Launch

### 1. Connect
We plug into your existing stack – like Zendesk, Intercom, HubSpot or your shared inbox – and pull your FAQs, help docs and real tickets.

### 2. Train
We train an AI assistant on your content, tone of voice and policies, then stress-test it on real scenarios before any customer sees it.

### 3. Launch
We launch in a controlled way, monitor performance, and make improvements each month so the assistant improves over time.

---

## Delivery Timeline

Most projects show **measurable improvements within 21 days** of onboarding. We take time to train, test, and verify your AI systems for accuracy before launch.

### When Will My Project Start?

| Signup Timing | Start Date |
|---------------|------------|
| On or before the **15th** of the month | Begin within **5 working days** |
| After the **15th** of the month | Begin on the **1st of the following month** |

This scheduling policy ensures our team is fully prepared and has time to schedule resources properly.

## Why Neurobotik? (Cost Comparison)

A typical support agent costs about **$3,000 per month** once you include salary, NI, training and management time.

Neurobotik **doesn't replace your team** – it takes the repetitive work away from them.

If your assistant can deflect even **30–40% of tickets** or save **30–60+ hours per month**, then a managed AI assistant is often cheaper than adding headcount – and it works 24/7, never takes time off, and keeps improving.
